# SCHISM-toolbox (v1.2-beta)

This is a MATLAB toolbox designed for the Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model ([SCHISM](http://ccrm.vims.edu/schismweb/)).

Last updated on 17 Aug 2025 by [Wenfan Wu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenfan-Wu/research), CCRM, Virginia Institute of Marine. Science.

## New features!!!

- Use structure arrays in IC/BC functions to allow variable-specific open boundaries and time series.
- Add functions for the serial/parallel extraction of open boundary or nudging data.
- Improve the efficiency of many file writing functions.
- Add SAL-related functions (self-attracting and loading tide).

More details can be found in the [Changelog.md](./doc/Changelog.md) file.

## Installation

To get started, just install the required add-ons and packages, then add `schism-toolbox` to the MATLAB search path.

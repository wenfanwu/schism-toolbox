% The resulting figure (CORIE_model_domain.png) can be found in the working
% path. In this figure, blue rectangle: open boundaries; red points: land
% nodes; green points: island nodes; 

% It is seen that there are four segments of open boundaries in this
% hgrid.gr3, including three river boundaries and one ocean boundary.
